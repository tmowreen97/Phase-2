# Simply Delicious
## Phase 2 Project

For my Phase 2 Project, I've created a page that allows the user to store recipes, and add new ones to their collection. / We have 4 different links accessible through the Navigation Bar: Home, About, My Recipes and Add Recipe. The Home page is simple, it just has the title of the page, *Simply Delicious*. The About page has a small description about what the user should expect out of this web page. The My Recipes page is where all the recipes are saved.
